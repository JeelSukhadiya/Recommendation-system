Recommendation system using TF-IDF algorithm
A dataset maintaing the Description of a number of items to be sold is maintained along with the unique id of the product.

Based on the search history the unique id of the product is given as the input and based on the TF-IDF algorithm the relevant recommendations are given according to the ranking based on similarity of description of products.

TF-IDF ALGORITHM
In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Tf-idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today; 83% of text-based recommender systems in digital libraries use tf-idf.
